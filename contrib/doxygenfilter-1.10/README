DoxyGen::Filter version 0.01
====================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is only useful if you also have doxygen installed, which can
be obtained from http://www.doxygen.org/

USAGE

The examples directory contains two "Doxyfile" and "PerlDoxyfile", with
PerlDoxyfile including Doxyfile. The idea is to have the common
(language-agnostic) options in Doxyfile and the perl-specific options in
PerlDoxyfile. Currently that's mostly the file pattern to use.

So, check those over and when they seem right just run "doxygen PerlDoxyfile".

You should get a directory api/html/ with nice docs.

The .pm files in the examples directory should give you a feel for how
to map the doxygen commands to perl.

Let me know what you think of it and what you feel is missing,
preferably with a syntax proposal.
